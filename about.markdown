Hi, I’m Vladimir — an iOS Engineer with years of experience developing software for Apple devices: iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac. I’m passionate about apps and in love with Apple technologies. I worked in different companies, both large and small. And also as a solo developer, making a living from my own apps on the App Store.
