<br/><br/>

Hi, I’m Vladimir — an iOS engineer with years of experience developing
software for Apple devices: iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac. I’m
passionate about apps and in love with Apple technologies. I worked in
different companies, both large and small. And also as a solo developer,
making a living from my own apps on the App Store.
